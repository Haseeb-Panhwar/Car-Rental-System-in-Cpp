# Car-Rental-System-in-Cpp
This was my second semester project using C++, it included use of fundamental concepts related to object oriented programming like polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction. In addition of use OOP concepts, it also prototyped a complete rental system including both the client side and customer side access through dedicated login system.
