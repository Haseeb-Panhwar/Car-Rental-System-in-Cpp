# Car-Rental-System-in-Cpp
This was my second-semester project using C++, it included the use of fundamental concepts related to object-oriented programming like polymorphism, inheritance, and abstraction. In addition of use OOP concepts, it also prototyped a complete rental system including both client-side and customer-side access through a dedicated login system.
